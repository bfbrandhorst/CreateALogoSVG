# CreateALogoSVG
 Create A Logo SVG is a node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file. The application also includes a shapes test that the user can run prior to creating their logo. Please reference the video and image links provided below to see the application's functionality. The link to my GitHub repository is also available to explore.  If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement you can find my email on my GitHub page!
